      <h2>Skiing ‚õ∑Ô∏è</h2>
        <p>
          Skiing is my favorite sport. I've been skiing since I could walk. I learned to ski in Chamrousse, a resort near my former village Uriage. This sport gives me a feeling of freedom and allows me to express my creativity as I wish while providing me with sensations

      <h2>Rugby üèâ</h2>
        <p>
          Rugby is my second favorite sport. I've been doing it since I was 6 years old. I started rugby thanks to my dad and I got hooked right away. It allowed me to make a lot of friends and to develop a certain team spirit. Since this year I play for the team of IESEG Lille, which allowed me to make a lot of friends of different ages

      <h2>Traveling ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
        <p>
          I love to travel and it is the most important thing for me. I love to discover new cultures, new landscapes, new flavors and to meet new people. I had the chance to travel in more than 15 countries such as Brazil, Mexico, Tanzania, Zanzibar...
          Soon, I would like to go to Canada for my university exchange and go to New York with my family.
